                <p><span class="about_highlight">Before I became a designer and developer, I had no idea what I really wanted to do.</span>
                <br>
                I had gone to university in the pursuit of a Bachelor's of Science - Computer Science degree. I had thought it was what I really wanted to do, ever since growing up with technology.
                I grew up playing so many different video games - World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, Guild Wars. I was obsessed with programming and always wanted to grow up becoming a video game developer.
                This led to me learning my first ever programming language: <span class="highlight_circle">C++</span>, and thus <span class="highlight_underline">began my programming journey</span>.
                I became enveloped in learning coding, so I could grow up becoming the idols of my youth; the people who shaped my childhood.
                <br>
                <span class="about_highlight">Enter: My College Years and my First Internships</span>
                <br>
                During my years of college, I always thought the key to success was through work experiences.
                My first year of college, I ended up going to class, while also doing 2 internships at once. Luckily, one of them was a fully-remote position for a company named <span class="highlight_underline">Hollwood Insider</span>.
                At Hollywood Insider, I was a Full-Stack Developer intern. I helped shape the company as it had begun, helping to create their website fully from the ground-up.
                It was definitely an exciting opportunity and I learned a lot, from the managerial and business side of the corporate world, to the techy engineering side.
                <br><span class="highlight_underline">It was my first taste of real world experience.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="about_highlight">However, what truly shaped me and made me realize my passion was my second internship: <span class="highlight_underline">Product Gym.</span></span>
                <br>
                At Product Gym, I had gone in as a Digital Marketing Specialist intern. This taught me the creative side of the industry.
                I was able to learn and utilize Adobe Photoshop, DaVinci Video Editor, Canva, Figma, and work exclusively with the design department, such as the videographer David.
                Since Product Gym was a startup when I joined, I was also the Full-Stack Developer intern at the same time. So not only was I able to create the designs for the website, but I was able to work on creating the website itself!
                <br>
                <span class="about_highlight">So, why Product Design?</span>
                <br>
                I loved the creative aspect of the work. At the very crux of Product Design, it's to be a story teller.
                My experiences at Hollywood Insider and at Product Gym, as well as FBS, have taught me not only to think outside of the box, but also to think empathetically when it comes to design.
                Taking in the different experiences and interactions I had with people - the different stories they were telling me and how I was able to convey all of that into a design, then into an actual product, is magical.
                <br><span class="about_highlight">Moving forward, I want to collaborate and expand my horizons with other designers, developers, and product owners
                    to create intuitive and empowering digital stories.
